    <h1>Don't eat less, eat right!</h1>
    <p>Will power is a finite resource. It will run out at some point, and your animalistic, instinct-driven brain will take over. (Remember that one time you ate a whole box of cookies?) Starving yourself doesn't work.
       In fact, when you starve yourself your body actually RETAINS fat, instead of burning it. It draws energy from your MUSCLES instead of your fat stores. You may be able to lose weight temporarily, but this system is not sustainable.
       At some point, you will need to eat food in order to feel full, and you will gain your weight back. The solution is a sustainable diet that tells your body you are full and puts your body into a fat-burning state.</p>
